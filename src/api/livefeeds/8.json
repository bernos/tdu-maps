MOV<\/b> who recorded his first win since the 2009 Vuelta a Burgos.\u000d\u000a The margin was centimetres, but on a count back of places from throughout, Gerrans was awarded the Ochre jersey.\u000d\u000aGerrans and Valverde will go in to tomorrow’s final stage on the same time, the first time this has happened since 2003.\u000d\u000aThere are time bonuses on offer at the two Jayco Sprints with more on the finish line but it remains to be seen what strategies GreenEDGE and Movistar employ.\u000d\u000aEarlier the customary break was allowed the escape, pretty much as soon as the red flag dropped.\u000d\u000aSix riders went away : <b>Stuart O'Grady (AUS) -

Sprint 2: <b>Thomas de Gendt (BEL) - VCD<\/b>, <b>Stuart O'Grady (AUS) - GEC<\/b>, <b>Andrew Fenn (GBR) - OPQ<\/b>.\u000d\u000aTheir lead grew to a maximum 8:10 before the peloton led mainly by BMC and Radioshack Nissan Trek began to reel them in.\u000d\u000aBut the chase was entirely successful because they didn’t catch all the riders in break before the first ascent of Willunga Hill. Most of them succumbed but <b>Nathan Haas (AUS) - GRM<\/b> didn’t. He rode away on the early part of the climb and summated ahead of the fast moving peloton which by now was strung out down the hill.\u000d\u000aIn fact Hass held on for most of the descent back into Willunga before a group of around 22 riders swamped him as they headed for the decisive second and final showdown on Willunga Hill.\u000d\u000aAnd as they began the final three kilometres of the stage, four riders made their move including <b>Rohan Dennis (AUS - SA) - UNA<\/b>, <b>Javier Moreno (ESP) - MOV<\/b>, <b>Jan Bakelants (BEL) - RNT<\/b> and <b>Tiago Machado (POR) - RNT<\/b>.\u000d\u000aDennis and Moreno then seemed to be running away with it before <b>Michael Rogers (AUS) - SKY<\/b> made his move. The 2002 TDU champion looked set for a 10th anniversary repeat but could only watch in admiration as first <b>Simon Gerrans (AUS) - GEC<\/b> and then <b>Alejandro Valverde (ESP) - MOV<\/b> made their dash inside the final 500m.\u000d\u000aGerrans surged to the front and with only the final left hand corner to go, looked to have Valverde’s measure. The Spaniard however had one more kick in him and it was too much for Gerrans as he bested him on the bend and edged over the line to snatch an emotional victory.\u000d\u000aIt’s the second consecutive win by a Spaniard on Old Willunga Hill and the fourth in total.\u000d\u000aBut Gerrans won’t be too disappointed with his day in the office. GreenEDGE have their much treasured Ochre Jersey and history tells us Gerrans will retain it tomorrow. If he does he’ll join O’Grady and Greipel as two time winners, but that dream has to wait, for now.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","Title":"","Type":"8"},{"Author":null,"Date":"\/Date(1327122647000+1100)\/","Guid":null,"LinkImage":null,"LinkVideo":null,"LinkWeb":null,"Text":"Jayco Sprint Leader: <b>Edvald Boasson Hagen (NOR) - SKY<\/b>\u000d\u000aSKODA KOM: <b>Rohan Dennis (AUS - SA) - UNA<\/b>\u000d\u000aCycle Instead Young Rider: <b>Rohan Dennis (AUS - SA) - UNA<\/b>\u000d\u000aHindmarsh Most Aggresive: <b>Stuart O'Grady (AUS) - GEC<\/b>\u000d\u000a ","Title":"","Type":"8"},{"Author":null,"Date":"\/Date(1327122531000+1100)\/","Guid":null,"LinkImage":null,"LinkVideo":null,"LinkWeb":null,"Text":"Provisional results: General Classification.\u000d\u000a1: <b>Simon Gerrans (AUS) - GEC<\/b>   \u000d\u000a2: <b>Alejandro Valverde (ESP) - MOV<\/b>  @st\u000d\u000a3: <b>Tiago Machado (POR) - RNT<\/b>  @0:09 \u000d\u000a4: <b>Michael Rogers (AUS) - SKY<\/b>  @0:14 \u000d\u000a5: <b>Rohan Dennis (AUS - SA) - UNA<\/b> @st\u000d\u000a6: <b>Edvald Boasson Hagen (NOR) - SKY<\/b>  @0:18\u000d\u000a7: <b>Jan Bakelants (BEL) - RNT<\/b>  @0:20\u000d\u000a8: <b>Javier Moreno (ESP) - MOV<\/b>  @0:24 \u000d\u000a9: <b>Michael Matthews (AUS) - RAB<\/b>  @0:30\u000d\u000a10:<b>Eduard Vorganov (RUS) - KAT<\/b>  @0:33","Title":"","Type":"8"},{"Author":null,"Date":"\/Date(1327122281000+1100)\/","Guid":null,"LinkImage":null,"LinkVideo":null,"LinkWeb":null,"Text":"Provisional results Jayco Stage 5:\u000d\u000a1:  <b>Alejandro Valverde (ESP) - MOV<\/b>\u000d\u000a2:  <b>Simon Gerrans (AUS) - GEC<\/b>   @st\u000d\u000a3:  <b>Tiago Machado (POR) - RNT<\/b>  @0:03\u000d\u000a4:  <b>Michael Rogers (AUS) - SKY<\/b>  @0:04\u000d\u000a5:  <b>Rohan Dennis (AUS - SA) - UNA<\/b> @0:07\u000d\u000a6:  <b>Edvald Boasson Hagen (NOR) - SKY<\/b>  @0:12\u000d\u000a7:  <b>Javier Moreno (ESP) - MOV<\/b>  @0:14\u000d\u000a8:  <b>Jan Bakelants (BEL) - RNT<\/b>  @st\u000d\u000a9:  <b>Jack Bauer (NZL) - GRM<\/b>  @0:26\u000d\u000a10: <b>Eduard Vorganov (RUS) - KAT<\/b>  @0:27\u000d\u000a     ","Title":"","Type":"8"},{"Author":null,"Date":"\/Date(1327121708000+1100)\/","Guid":null,"LinkImage":null,"LinkVideo":null,"LinkWeb":null,"Text":"GreenEDGE sports director Matt White says his team will gamble Gerrans finishing ahead of Valverde on the finish line sprint tomorrow.
