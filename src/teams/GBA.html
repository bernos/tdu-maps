        to create a new team that has been known as Garmin-Barracuda. The team
        sponsors share the key philosophies of developing the next generation of
        cycling champions and declare an unwavering commitment to ethical sport.

    <p>
        The goals for 2012 continue to derive from the ethos of the organization,
        that of team achievement over that of the individual. This philosophy saw

        The team had their strongest season in the history of the team in 2011,
        and will be looking to build on that success in 2012.
