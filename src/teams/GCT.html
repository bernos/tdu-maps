        Simon Gerrans, winner of the Tour Down Under in 2006, and Stuart O'Grady,
        twice an overall Tour Down Under winner in the race's early editions and
        second overall in 2009, will bolster general classification ambitions.

        Robbie McEwen holds the impressive record of 12 Santos Tour Down Under
        stage wins, making him the only rider in the history of the event to claim

        McEwen has won the Jayco Sprint General Classification (overall) at the
        2002, 2004, and 2005 Santos Tour Down Under events.

        three Grand Tours: Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.

        Stuart O'Grady won the 2007 Paris Roubaix and is a three time Tour de
