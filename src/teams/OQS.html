        THE RIDERS: DID YOU KNOW?
    </p>
    <p>
        Gerald Ciolek, Vuelta a Espana stage winner (Stage 2, 2009) and German
        National Road Race Champion (2005) will headline the Omega Pharma Quick-Step
        team for the 2012 Santos Tour Down Under.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gerald rode the 2011 Santos Tour Down Under and finished 25th overall
        in the Cycle Instead Young Rider classification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ciolek is a great team leader and a young, accomplished rider, taking
        honours in 2006 as the UCI U23 World Road Race Champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ciolek is a strong lead out man. This was evident when he rode for Team
        Columbia in 2008. At the 2008 Tour de France, he was an instrumental figure
        in all four of Mark Cavendish's stage wins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Serge Pauwels returns to the Santos Tour Down Under, possibly with a SKODA
        King of the Mountain victory firmly set in his sights. In 2007, he claimed
        the overall King of the Mountain victory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Andrew Fenn took third place, the bronze medal, in the 2011 UCI World
        Road Championships, U23 division.
    </p>
    <p>
        Matthew Brammeier will join Omega Pharma Quick Step for the 2012 season,
        hot off an impressive 2011, where he claimed both the Irish National Road
        Race and Time Trial Champion titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gert Steegmans, is a two time Tour de France and Paris-Nice stage winner
        and has been Robbie McEwen's Tour de France pilot in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Omega Pharma Quick-Step team has been targeting young riders in its
        recruitment and this is evident by the inclusion of team stagiaire, Matteo
        Trentin with the team at the 2012 Santos Tour Down Under.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trentin signed with the team in August 2011 and is the current U23 Italian
        National Road Race Champion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Julien Vermote is entering his second season with the Quick-Step team.
    </p>
    <p>
        THE TEAM: DID YOU KNOW?
    </p>
    <p>
        Omega Pharma and Quick-Step have joined forces in 2012 to present a Belgian
        super cycling team.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both sponsors were first name sponsors of their own teams in 2011 but
        are joining forces for the new season, having previously working together
        in 2003 and 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2010 Quick-Step signed a three year deal with the Eddy Merckx Cycle
        Company to supply bikes for the entire team.
